Original request / feature

- Fix React hooks eslint warning in `app/page.tsx` about missing `stopAudioAnalysis` dependency.

Challenges

- Exhaustive-deps required stable callbacks and ordering to avoid use-before-define.

Successes

- Reordered audio helper callbacks before the Deepgram effect and wrapped them in `useCallback`.
- Removed unused PDF text state, relying on refs only.

Methods that did/didn’t work

- Considered only adding the dependency, but that conflicted with declaration order; refactoring callbacks + deps resolved the warning without disabling lint rules.

Changes made to the codebase (≤50 lines shown when applicable)

- `app/page.tsx`: audio helpers now use `useCallback` and are declared before the session effect; effect deps include `startAudioAnalysis`, `stopAudioAnalysis`, and `analyzePitch`. Unused `pdfText` state removed.
